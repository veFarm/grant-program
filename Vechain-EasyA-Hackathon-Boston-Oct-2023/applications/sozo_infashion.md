### Overview

We are Sozo inFashion, formerly known as Artika Refashion, a marketplace that connects independent fashion designers with users for fixing, upstyling, and innovating fashion. Following extensive discussions and research, three original Artika Refashion team members—Zi, Anna, and Alika—have identified a better opportunity to champion sustainable fashion by applying Vechain's innovative approach to Web3. While Sozo remains a marketplace connecting independent fashion designers to users, it differs from Artika by encouraging the commissioning of new fashion pieces rather than fixing and upstyling. This process is akin to a consumer commissioning an artist for a painting. The idea emerged when we realized that the back-and-forth shipping process for delivering used clothing pieces to a fashion designer would result in a surge in carbon emissions, contradicting our mission of promoting sustainable fashion. With Sozo, we limit the shipment to a one-way process, and we have future plans to reduce carbon emissions as the project grows.

Vechain Application
Unlike Artika, where NFTs are created for each clothing piece, we shift our main focus to designers—the backbone of this app. With Sozo, designers are each affiliated with blockchain technology to track their design history. This ensures that designers receive proper credit for their work, and users can trust a designer's experience.

**The New Approach** <br>
For Sozo, we have adopted the lean startup methodology, testing the product through rigorous user surveys, market research, and finding a product-market fit before fully developing the tech. Our general approach involves using the initial round of funding to conduct extensive interviews with fashion designers, customers, and various small fashion brands. This provides a better understanding of necessary app features and uncovers potential problems. Once we gather sufficient user data and conduct thorough market research, we will begin building the technical aspects. Simultaneously, we will conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to ensure that we are always attuned to the needs of our designers and users.

**Why Sozo inFashion and not Artika Refashion** <br> 
As different philosophies and Vechain implementation ideas emerged while working on Artika Refashion, our team split into two. The main differences between Sozo and Artika are as follows:

- At Sozo, we firmly believe that implementing blockchain technology for designers, rather than focusing solely on clothing, aligns more closely with our core philosophy of prioritizing support for designers. Our goal is to revolutionize the demanding fashion industry for designers by harnessing the power of Vechain's sustainable blockchain. Vechain's blockchain stands out with EVM compatibility, low gas fees, and a dedicated emphasis on sustainability. With its extensive ecosystem of libraries, we are confident that it will deliver the optimal development and user experience for our platform. By integrating Vechain, we not only streamline the design process but also contribute to a more sustainable and efficient fashion industry, empowering designers to thrive in a cutting-edge, environmentally conscious landscape.
- At Sozo, we believe that engaging with customers and designers first provides greater strength in building a successful product that people will use. Rather than building an app without talking to potential customers, we believe that this approach is crucial to creating something enduring.

- React Native frontend to create single codebase for all platforms (iOS, Android, Web).
- back4app BaaS to efficiently create, manage and scale backend resources.
- RESTful API backend made with back4app.
- Real-time database, provided by back4app, to store user data and link related objects.

### PoC
Our PoC was submitted to the VeChain/EasyA hackathon and can be found https://github.com/KShervington/sozo-app

### Ecosystem Fit
We distinguish ourselves with a digital platform connecting independent fashion designers to users. This platform enables users to commission new fashion pieces, akin to acquiring an art piece. We've identified a prevalent issue in the fashion industry—many independent designers often find themselves working in roles they dislike, all in pursuit of an opportunity with a larger design firm or brand.

Our ultimate objective is to become the Spotify for fashion.

## Future Plans

### Sozo 1.0:
Develop a decentralized platform that actively connects designers and users, streamlining sustainable fashion. Utilize blockchain technology to represent each designer, ensuring meticulous tracking and verification of every fashion piece. This strategy aims to enhance credibility within our fashion designer ecosystem.

### Sozo 2.0: The Spotify of Fashion
Introduce a "sustainably produced" line of clothing, tracked through NFTs and historical records in the supply chain. Our tokenized loyalty system will include Early Access Tokens and VIP Event Access Tokens, which enhance demand and create unique opportunities for users. This collaboration is mutually beneficial, allowing luxury brands to build a "green" reputation without sacrificing profits while gaining new customers. Sozo 2.0 also enables users to trade redesigned clothing, boosting engagement and demand. Our long-term vision is to become the go-to social media app in the Web3 fashion industry for entertainment, inspiration, and services.

## Additional Information 

We have already created UI mockups and a pitch deck which was presented at the Vechain/EasyA hackathon at Harvard. We won 2nd place on the BCG track with these assets, and have edited them since then to reflect the budget and time available provided by this grant. Our original application Artika Refashion is no longer a part of this current team and the current team is no longer affiliated with Artika Refashion. We believe that this new approach for applying Vechain to our sustainable fashion tech, we would be able to adopt a far greater usage of the application. We also believe that our current team of 4 has more horsepower to drive the project far greater than what the hackathon had to offer. We are excited to build this and test it. Thank you for your consideration and please reach out if there are any questions or concersn about our previous application and we will be happy to resolve any concerns.
